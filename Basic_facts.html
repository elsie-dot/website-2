<p>Here we will go through what each term means for the drivers, track information,how many drivers and teams, past driver drama to help you understand what's going
   on now between teams or drivers, certain terminology, history of drivers (who recently left or drove) etc </p>

<h2> Terminology <h2>
<p>Terminology is the best starter as it'll help you understand what commentators are saying in the actual race, and it'll help you have a better understanding of 
  the sport in general </p>

<h4> Apex <h4>
<p>The innermost point of the driving line taken through a corner. Driving as close as possible to the apex (hitting the apex) ensures the driver is taking the 
  straightest possible line and maintaining the highest speed through a corner. </p>

<h4> Backmarker <h4>
<p>A slower car that is often lapped (sometime multiples times) during the race by the leading cars. Backmarkers are shown a blue flag by marshals, which indicates 
  a faster car is approaching and the driver should move out of the way safely.</p>

<h4> Chassis <h4> 
<p>The base frame or main supporting structure of a Formula 1 car to which elements such as the engine and suspension systems are attached. Sometimes also known 
  as a monocoque chassis, because of the way in which the chassis is integrated with the strong carbon fibre body (or shell) of the car to better protect the 
  driver in accidents. </p>

<h4> Chicane <h4> 
<p> A series of corners on a circuit, normally taken at low speed, that features at least two changes of direction. Chicanes are often added to high-speed sections 
  of a circuit to slow the cars down, improving safety and encouraging more overtaking. The majority of current Formula 1 circuits feature at least one chicane. </p>

<h4> Cockpit <h4> 
<p> The area of the chassis where the driver sits. In modern F1 cars, the driver is almost laying down on a carbon fibre seat that has been specifically moulded 
  to their body shape. Modern F1 steering wheels are also highly advanced, featuring a digital display and an array of buttons to control different functions and 
  paddles for changing gears. </p>

<h4> Downforce </h4> 
<p> The areodynamic force that pushes cars downward at speed, making them stick to the ground and improving cornering forces. Front and rear wings, as well as 
  diffusers and other aerodynamic elements that create downforce are a significant focus of modern F1 car design. </p>


<h4> DRS </h4>
<p> Meaning - Drag Reduction System. It is activated by drivers to increase the top speed of the car and make overtaking easier. It works by opening an adjustable 
  flap on the rear wing of the car. DRS can only be activated at specific detection points when the pursuing car is within one second of the car in front.

<h4> Formation lap </h4> 
<p>The lap that immediately precedes the start of the race. During the relatively slow formation lap, the grid is cleared of mechanics and other team members 
  ready for the cars to line up once again and begin racing. Also known as the warm-up lap or parade lap </p> 

<h4> Halo </h4> 
<p> A cockpit safety structure that was introduced to Formula 1 in 2018 and has already been credited with saving the lives of several drivers. Resembling a 
  horseshoe, the halo consists of a bar that surrounds the drivers head and is bolted to the chassis at three points. </p>

  <h4> Overcut/unercut </h4> 
<p> Race strategies that involve a driver attempting to pass the car in front during a pit stop window. A successful overcut involves the pursuing driver pitting 
  after the car in front and setting faster lap times on a clear track to emerge in front after taking their own pit stop shortly after. A successful undercut sees
   the pursuing driver enter the pits before the car in front and take advantage of fresher tyres to gain track position when the other driver makes their pit stop. </p>

<h4> Oversteer/Understeer </h4>
<p> Opposite terms used in Formula 1 to describe the sensitivity of a cars front end to steering inputs. Oversteer happens when a car turns (or steers) more than 
  a driver intends, while understeer happens when a car turns less than a driver intends. Although both phenomena have negative effects on tyre wear and lap times,
   F1 drivers and designers are more likely to tolerate a car with oversteer rather than understeer, as it allows more speed to be carried into a corner and 
   ultimately faster lap times this advantage, however, comes with a cost of greater front-end instability and a higher risk of spinning out. </p> 

   <h4> Paddock </h4> 
<p> The area behind the team garages (or pits) at every Formula 1 circuit that is home to the teams technical staff and equipment, catering, media, 
  race officials and other important functions that contribute to the successful running of the race weekend. Access to the Paddock is tightly controlled, 
  though F1 Experiences does offer guided tours and day passes with selected packages.</p>

<h4> Pits </h4>
<p> The area at a circuit that houses the team garages. The pits are accessed by a special section of the circuit called the pit lane where speeds are limited 
  (from pit entry to pit exit), and drivers stop during the race in front of their teams garage for pit stops to change tyres or repair mechanical issues. 
  Senior members of each team sit at special stations with banks of computers on the pit wall located on the track side of the pit lane closer to the circuit
   to monitor their cars performance during practice, qualifying and the race. </p>
