<h1>The Meaning Behind the Box Notes Name</h1>
</header>
<p> The name of the website is Box Notes, and you may be wondering why I chose that name. Well, the name is a play on words. In Formula 1, a "box" is a term used to refer to the pit stop area where the cars stop to change tyres and other maintenance</p>
<p> The "notes" part refers to the fact that this website is a place where I will be taking notes about all things Formula One - from basic facts to advanced strategies and insights.</p>

<p> So, the name "Box Notes" is a combination of the pit stop area and the idea of taking notes about the sport. I hope you enjoy reading my notes and learning more about Formula 1! </p>
