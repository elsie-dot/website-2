                <p> Welcome to Box Notes! My website will be a helpful guide to help those who are new to the sport or
                        who simply need a refresher on all the rules and regulations that come with the sport. First up
                        is the drivers: </p>
                <p><b><a href="#Section_further_down">Take me to the drivers</a></b></p>

<div class="center-image">

</div>
<p> I hope that the website will help those gain more knowledge on the sport so they can
speak freely about it without being judged by those who seem to know so much. Considering that this sport can
be fairly judgemental towards other fans (as with any other sport) many people may feel that
they cannot express their love for the sport in fear of being questioned about topics that they
don't know about yet, meaning that they would be listed as a fake fan. </p>

<p> As someone who has only properly started watching and learning about Formula one since around 2020,
        and still has to google a few things about the sport, I understand how difficult it is to raise
        an opinion and then feel scrutinised because I don't know all of the deep facts on that topic.
        Which is why i will also include facts on:</p>
<ul>
        <li> What each tyre type means and when it is best to use them </li>
        <li> What each part of the car does to help the team gain some points</li>
        <li> Tips on each track every weekend </li>
</ul>
<p>Which is why I want my website to be a safe place for those to come and learn so they can impress
        those who scrutinised them. But I don't want them to only learn from my website because of that.
        I want them to visit this site because they have a genuine interest in the sport and want to
        support whoever they want without judgement. </p>
